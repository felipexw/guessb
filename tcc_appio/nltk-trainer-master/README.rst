NLTK Trainer
------------

NLTK Trainer exists to make training and evaluating NLTK objects as easy as possible.


Requirements
------------

You must have Python >=2.6 (but not 3.x) with `argparse <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse/>`_ and `NLTK <http://www.nltk.org/>`_ 2.0 installed. `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_, `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_, and `megam <http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/megam/>`_ are recommended for training Maxent classifiers. To use the sklearn classifiers, you must also install `scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_.

If you want to use any of the corpora that come with NLTK, you should `install the NLTK data <http://nltk.org/data.html>`_.


Documentation
-------------

Documentation can be found at `nltk-trainer.readthedocs.org <http://nltk-trainer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ (you can also find these documents in the `docs directory <https://github.com/japerk/nltk-trainer/tree/master/docs>`_. Many of the scripts are covered in `Python 3 Text Processing with NLTK 3 Cookbook <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1782167854/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1782167854&linkCode=as2&tag=streamhacker-20&linkId=K2BYHHUBZ4GIEW4L>`_, and every script provides a ``--help`` option that describes all available parameters.
